# calculator
I have created the calculator app based on the example of Bart. 

## How does the app work
The app can be used for calculating things. The default functions for an calculator are available. 

## Used technique
The app is build in Ionic. Ionic is build over the Angular webframework. 

## Install
Step 1: clone this repo with Git. 

Step 2: run `npm install`

Step 3: generate the app on your device by using two commands:

- Ios: `cordova run ios`
- Android: `cordova run android`

Step 4: the interface can also be run in the browser with: `ionic serve`
